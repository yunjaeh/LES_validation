Validation of wind-driven ventilation experiment using Large-eddy simulation
---

## Reference experiment
- wind speed / roughness length
- geometry size
[citataion: add link]()

## Simulation setup: referencee case
- E1 (two openings at center), wall porosity 10%
- add figure, link to the field
- movie

## inflow optimzation
- Xie and Castro
- Gradient-based inflow optimization
- add inflow optimization result

## Sensitivity study
- inflow condition
- Grid sensitivity study

## Configurations
- Various ventilation configurations  
- and flow directions

## Quantity of interest
1. Ventilation rate / orifice equation
- velocity at opening
- pressure 
2. Age of air ()
- Scalar transport equation
3. discharge coefficient?
